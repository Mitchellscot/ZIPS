# Zipline Image Photo System (ZIPS)

## Description

_Development Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

This project was designed to be an alternative revenue stream for an existing adventure park. There are a number of required working parts in order for it to work in addition to this main repo:

- A Raspberry Pi HQ Camera, Raspberry Pi computer with Node and Motion installed
- An Amazon Web Services account
- It is assumed that the camera would operate on the local network of the business, though the main website (this repo) would be deployed.

Because this project has a few mobing components, the best way to see the application in action is to [view this demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei-ZUtdrTKw)
To view the other required software that runs on the Raspbery Pi, see [this repo](https://github.com/Mitchellscot/zips-pi-server)
